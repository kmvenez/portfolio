      <h1 id="name">Hi, Iâ€™m Katie. ðŸ‘‹</h1>
      <p>Iâ€™m a Shakespearean-trained actress turned Full-Stack Software Engineer.  Iâ€™ve done everything from leading tours at Radio City Music Hall (ask me about the time I yelled at G-Eazy) to tech recruiting for a startup acquired by Microsoft.  At the end of the day, all of my stories and experiences have the same theme: I love a good process.  I am methodical, detail-oriented and hungry for my next challenge (and tacos) If youâ€™re looking for someone who knows web development and the hiring process with technical expertise â€“ letâ€™s chat.</p>
